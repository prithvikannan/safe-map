# Safe Map

The app lets users take photos of situations that they believe are dangerous, checks to see if it is actually dangerous, and displays those on a map for the community to see.

We built the app using react native for the front end, Firebase for the backend, and Google Cloud Vision and Natural Language Processing to verify dangerous situations.

This app was sumbmitted to LAHacks with Aayush Patel, Manav Bhatia, Neel Saswade, and Nicolas Heuchert
